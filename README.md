# Suppor_vector_Mechanism

# PROJECT TITLE :

Using the Support_Vector_Mechanisam Algorithm by Supervised Machine Learning, Predict "Iris.csv" data set to find out the Species will be same or different

# Problem Statement :

 A American based Botanical garden grow Iris flower in their labs but using bio techonology in a single Tree different types of variety flower is grow.
 Find out as a Data Science Engineer how much accurcy is there all category contain same spacies.

 # TASK :  
      1. Preprocess the data in Scikit.learn library 
      
      2. Load the data using Sklearn model selection default argument

      3. On the basis of data train,test and split the S_V_M model 

      4. Implement support vector mechanism classfier.The S_V_M must be "Linear" 

      5. Trian the classfier on the training data.

      6. Find out the prediction value on the test data.

      7. Test the model with the help of accuracy , accuracy should be lie in the range of 0-1.


   # Conclusion :
   
   According to my support vector mechanism model the spices are linear. By the accuracy of 1.00.

   Hence proved nodel was sucessful implemt
